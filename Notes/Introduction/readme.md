# Use Case Diagram:

A use case describes how a user uses a system to accomplish a particular goal.A use case diagram consists of the `system`, the related `use cases` and `actors` and relates these to each other to visualize: what is being described? `(system)`, who is using the system? `(actors)` and what do the actors want to achieve? `(use cases)`, thus, use cases help ensure that the correct system is developed by capturing the requirements from the user's point of view.

A use case (or set of use cases) has these characteristics:

- Organizes functional requirements
- Models the goals of system/actor (user) interactions
- Describes one main flow of events (main scenarios) and possibly other exceptional flows (alternatives), also called paths or user scenarios
